## Internship Opportunity Offered to 35 Candidates for Dispatch.

Last year, forty-two students applied for the 2024 Trainee Selection Examination, and 35 of them were selected as candidates for dispatch.<br>
As a result of close negotiations with each member country, we obtained 32 offers* that were in line with each candidate's area of expertise and preferences. 

Meanwhile, a total of 37 offers from Japanese internship hosts were provided to each member country.

IAESTE Japan will continue to support the candidates until they start their internship.<br>
*Offers: Documents indicating the internship offered by the internship host.
