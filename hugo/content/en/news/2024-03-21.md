title: "April recruitment of internship students"

We accept April applications for internship students from `April 1st (Mon) to April 25th (Thu)`.

Please note that the only offer type available for the April recruitment is the `Global Internship`, which differs from the `Exchange Internship` in that it requires a higher English test score and has a different training availability period.

Applicants must be `at least a third-year undergraduate student` and `enrolled in a Japanese university or graduate school` at the time of the internship.

For details, please refer to the `Appliction Guidelines (for April)` at the following page.
